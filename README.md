# recruitment-node-private 1.3.0

This assignment requires you to implement a feature within the context of the existing setup. The objective isn't merely to impress us but to produce a robust piece of work.<br/>
We believe in the saying: 'If it's worth doing, it's worth doing right.' We expect you to approach this task with diligence, aiming to create something that you'd proudly reference or use even a year from now.

We'll be evaluating the entirety of your code and how effectively you've utilised the existing setup, rather than just checking for functionality. <br/>
If you have reservations about the conventions used in the setup, kindly annotate your concerns instead of altering the provided framework.

⚠️ Please make sure to provide all data needed to start the app.

Good luck!

## Installation

- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) lts or latest version
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

- In root dir run `npm install`
- In root dir run `docker compose up -d` to run Postgres and PgAdmin docker images for local development
- Create a .env file with the content from .env.dev

## Database

Postgres database will be available on http://localhost:5440

PgAdmin UI will be available on http://localhost:80

Connect to PgAdmin UI using:

- login in the UI (username: `postgres@gmail.com`, password: `postgres`)
- host: `host.docker.internal`
- port: `5440`
- username/password/maintenance database:`postgres`

## Running the app

Make sure to run the migrations before running the app (see Migrations section below)

### Development:

- To start the project in dev mode, run `npm run start:dev`

### Production:

- To build the project, run `npm run build`
- To start the project in prod mode, run `npm run start:prod`

### Testing:

- Please note the tests setup will use env vars from `.env.test`

- To run all tests once, run `npm run test`
- To run all tests and watch for changes `npm run test:watch`
- To run single test file and watch for changes `npm run test:watch -- src/modules/auth/tests/auth.service.spec.ts`

### Lint:

- To run the lint, run `npm run lint`

Application runs on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

## Migrations

Migration scripts:

- `npm run migration:generate --path=moduleName --name=InitialMigration` - automatically generates migration files with
  schema changes made
- `npm run migration:create --path=moduleName --name=CreateTableUsers` - creates new empty migration file
- `npm run migration:run` - runs migration
- `npm run migration:revert` - reverts last migration
- `npm run migration:show` - shows the list of migrations
- you can also use `npm run test:migration:run`, `npm run test:migration:show` and `npm run test:migration:revert` to
  manage testing database

## Swagger

Swagger will be available on http://localhost:3000/docs by default

You can find swagger documentation [here](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/)

# Small code exercises

1. Please write a function to transform array to containing number and strings.

   - e.g `['super', '20.5', 'test', '23' ]` -> `['super', 20.5, 'test', 23 ]`

2. Please write a function to return an array of all files with `csv` extension in folder `/files`

3. Please write a function to return if a string contains a digit
   - e.g `'test-string'` -> `false`
   - e.g `'test-string23'` -> `true`

# Farms Task - API

## Setup

- Use created app
- Free to add additional packages
- Use existing user authentication. Make sure all added endpoints are only accessible for authenticated users

## Requirements

### General

1. Need to have test

### Model

1. Add `address` & `coordinates` to User
2. Add Farm. A Farm should belong to specific user & have following
   properties: `name`, `address`, `coordinates`, `size` (e.g 21.5) & `yield` (e.g. 8.5)

### API

_Add API that supports following requirements:_

- As a user I want to be able to retrieve a list of all farms **of all users** (max 100 records a time).

  - The list should contain following properties:

    - `name`
    - `address`
    - `owner` (email)
    - `size`
    - `yield`
    - `driving distance` (travel distance from farm to requesting user's address)<br/>
      For **driving distance** you can use Distance-Matrix API of
      _Google_ https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/distance-matrix (token provided
      in email)
      - Please ignore rate limitations, as they should be explained later (See "Task") and don't need to be coded.

  - The user should be able to get list **sorted** by

    - **name** (a to z)
    - **date** (newest first)
    - **driving distance** (closest first)

  - The user should be able to get list **filtered** by
    - **outliers** (Boolean) (outliers = the yield of a farm is 30% below or above of the average yield of all
      farms).

### Task

- Please explain in the Readme how to handle rate limitation (write it as if you are making a PoC and you want to
  explain it to the rest of your team)
  - Max 25 pr. request
  - Max 10 requests pr. seconds
